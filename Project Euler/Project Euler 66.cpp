	Diophantine Equations
	Interestingly, this problem can be solved by expressing square roots of n as continued fractions and taking the minimum of the difference between squares of the numerator and product of n and the denominator.
	This Problem needs a program which can handle very large numbers exceeding 2^64. When I tried implementing it with mathematical operations on strings it took too much time.
